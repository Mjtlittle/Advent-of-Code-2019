# Advent-of-Code-2019
My submissions for the advent of code 2019

## Layout and Organization
Organization of this repository was inspired by [MrRobb's Rust Repo](https://github.com/MrRobb/advent-of-code-2019). I later reformatted this repo and the first day formatting was inspired by Robb.

All of the days are placed into their own file and for programs that require the intcode interpreter they can import it within the respective day.

## Day Comments

Programs that use intcode: 
- 2
- 5
- 7
- 9
- 11 (needs run until input)

Unfinished Days: 
- 3: intersection wires
- 7: amps, unique permutations
- 10: rewrite it
- 11: not started
